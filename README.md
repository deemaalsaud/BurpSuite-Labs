# Burp Suite Labs

This repo is just me practicing **PortSwigger Web Security Academy labs** using Burp Suite.  
I’m keeping everything here so I can track my progress and have notes to look back on later.  

## How it’s organized
- Every vulnerability type has its own folder (SQLi, XSS, Auth, CSRF, etc).
- Inside each folder, I’ll add the labs I’ve done with simple write-ups.
- Each write-up = what the lab was, how I solved it, and what I learned.

## Index

### SQL Injection (SQLi)
- [01 – SQLi: Retrieve hidden products](sqli/01-sqli-hidden-products.md)
- [02 – SQLi: Login bypass](sqli/02-sqli-login-bypass.md)

---

## How I write each lab
- **Goal** → what the lab wanted me to do  
- **Steps** → what I tried, payloads, and how I solved it  
- **Evidence** → screenshot or notes showing it worked  
- **Why it was vulnerable** → the root cause in plain English  
- **Fix** → how it *should* be fixed  
- **Notes** → anything that confused me or tips for myself later
